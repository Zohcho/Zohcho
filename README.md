## About me
**As a former support engineer, I have a deep understanding of users and their**
**issues, which assists me in working with requirements, test planning, and**
**analyzing actual results. Having once encountered a high volume of support**
**tasks, I created user documentation that helped reduce the number of such**
**tasks by 50%, from 30-40 to 15-20 per month.**
**I really like Unity3D because this engine offers an immense array of**
**possibilities, it versatile and has a huge, friendly community. I've already**
**gained proficiency in working with objects, components, animations, UI,**
**particle systems, sound, and more**
