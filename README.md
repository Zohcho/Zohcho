## About me
**My transition into QA was justified by my years of experience working as a Support Engineer. I can tell you, this experience has given me a tremendous advantage. Everyone knows test-design methods, mastering them isn't that challenging; what's difficult is learning to apply them effectively. Unlike most entry-level testers who rarely consciously go beyond a few such methods, I managed to reduce the number of errors coming into support by about 30% using a relatively simple method of states and transitions, along with support call statistics.**

**My life always was closely intertwined with computer games. It all started in 1999 with Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and then it's like a dream: the first landing in Normandy in Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, the first crime in GTA: Vice City, the first hyperspace jump in Freelancer, and so on and so forth.**
**Making games is my dream, and I'm taking steps towards it. I started learning Unity because this engine offers an immense array of possibilities, it versatile and has a huge, friendly community. I've already gained proficiency in working with objects, components, animations, UI, particle systems, sound, and more**
